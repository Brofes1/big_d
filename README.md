# big_d

A library created by me to handle numbers bigger than 1.8e308, up to e1.8e308 <br>
Name shamelessly stole from BudEBoy _- "I want a big_d too!"_ <br>

# Functions
<b> bool compareGreater(big_d, big_d) </b> <br>
Compares the first value with the second value, if bigger than, outputs true, otherwise false. <br><br>
<b> bool compareLess(big_d, big_d) </b> <br>
The same as compareGreater, but checks if the second value is bigger than the first.
